# PyRapt
An implementation of David Talkin's RAPT (Robust Algorithm for Pitch Tracking) in Python. This is an educational excercise as part of my thesis project work at Harvard Extension School.

### Introduction

This is an algorithm proposed by David Talkin in this paper:
> Talkin, David. "A robust algorithm for pitch tracking (RAPT)." Speech coding and synthesis 495 (1995): 518.

### Installation Notes

This module is currently being developed for use with Python 2.7. Because the scipy/numpy libraries are dependencies, make sure you can obtain and build those packages first (need fortran compiler, python dev packages, and ability to comipile c extensions)
